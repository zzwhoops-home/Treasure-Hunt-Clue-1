# Treasure Hunt - Clue 1 (Cryptography)

This was one of the clues in a treasure hunt I made with a friend, involving the use of fernet encryption and visual cryptography.
Using clues on a Google Doc, participants had to find passwords that would be used to generate a secret key. That key would also be the secret key of a fernet-encrypted message. Upon decrypting three strings, you would unlock a "treasure chest" in this clue to receive a link for the next part of the clue.
The next part was visual cryptography, where two images are overlaid to form a secret, hidden image using some magical wizardry of overlaying pixels.
